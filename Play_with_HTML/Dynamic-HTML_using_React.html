<!--  CDN stands for  Content Delivery Network
     we are injecting cdn links to our html file using script tag
    we are getting react and react-dom libraries using cdn links
    root & render () wiill be write in single time in our code & everything else will be write inside it. 

    {} ==> this is the props object, this is used for passing the data to the tag attributes. 
           all the tag attributes are comming from the props object.
    Render method is used to modify the DOM.

<!--  Own Create React App branch -->
<!-- HERE, we are use react using cdn links which is in local.

    what happen when react new version is released? like 18 to 19.
        then we have to again go to cdn & get the new url for the React library. do the same stuff.

    CDN, is hosted on the un-pkg.com server.
    Node Modules has on our server either in the local or in the cloud with the help of package-lock.json file.
        so, fetching the React library from the other CDN server is not a good idea.
        so, we are going to use the React library from the node modules folder. it will be faster. because it is on our server.
            so, we will install React & React-dom library in our project folder.
                by doing ==>  npm install react react-dom
   we will not do npm install -d react react-dom because we want to use this library in our production environment.
